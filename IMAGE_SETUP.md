### Logo Image for Hero Section

The LOGO.JPG file couldn't be automatically copied due to permissions. Please manually copy it:

1. **Copy the file**:
   ```bash
   cp ~/Downloads/LOGO.JPG /Users/coley/Documents/GitHub/Diamondportfolio/public/images/logo.jpg
   ```

   Or drag and drop:
   - From: `~/Downloads/LOGO.JPG`
   - To: `/Users/coley/Documents/GitHub/Diamondportfolio/public/images/logo.jpg`

2. **Verify it's in place**:
   The Hero component is already configured to use `/images/logo.jpg`

3. **Refresh your browser** to see the logo in the hero section
